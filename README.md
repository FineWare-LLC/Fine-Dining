# Fine Dining

Fine Dining is a web and mobile application that provides personalized meal planning, nutritional tracking, and restaurant recommendations. It leverages powerful optimization techniques—such as linear programming with Google OR-Tools—to deliver cost-effective, nutritionally balanced meal plans for both individuals and larger institutions (schools, hospitals, corporate wellness programs, etc.).

## Key Features

- **Personalized Meal Plans**  
  Create weekly meal plans based on calories, dietary restrictions (allergies), budget, and other preferences.
- **Nutritional Tracking**  
  Log meals in real-time and track daily/weekly stats (calories, macros, vitamins, etc.).
- **Restaurant Recommendations**  
  Search for nearby restaurants that match your dietary constraints or preferences (powered by external APIs).
- **Automatic Grocery Lists**  
  Generate grocery lists from planned recipes and track ingredient availability.
- **Cost Optimization**  
  Uses linear programming to minimize meal plan expenses while respecting nutritional constraints and user preferences.

## Architecture Overview

Fine Dining follows a microservices-like architecture:

1. **Frontend**  
   - Developed with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) (Web) and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) (Mobile).  
   - Consumes RESTful APIs and displays an intuitive UI for meal planning, nutritional stats, and user profiles.

2. **Backend**  
   - Built on [Node.js + Express](https://expressjs.com/) to handle API requests.  
   - Integrates optimization engines (e.g., [Google OR-Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization)) for cost-effective meal planning.

3. **Database**  
   - Uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for flexible, document-based storage of user profiles, recipes, and meal plans.

4. **Security**  
   - [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) for secure user sign-up and login.  
   - HTTPS/TLS encryption for data in transit.
